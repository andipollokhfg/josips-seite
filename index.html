        <h1>Universal Declaration of Human Rights</h1>
        <h2>Preambel</h2>
        <div>Presented by Josip Holinski</div>
        <p>Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the
            human
            family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world, Whereas disregard and contempt for
            human
            rights have resulted in barbarous acts which have outraged the conscience of mankind, and the advent of a
            world
            in which human beings shall enjoy freedom of speech and belief and freedom from fear and want has been
            proclaimed as the highest aspiration of the common people, Whereas it is essential, if man is not to be
            compelled to have recourse, as a last resort, to rebellion against tyranny and oppression, that human rights
            should be protected by the rule of law, Whereas it is essential to promote the development of friendly
            relations
            between nations, Whereas the peoples of the United Nations have in the Charter reaffirmed their faith in
            fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person and in the equal rights of men and
            women
            and have determined to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom, Whereas
            Member
            States have pledged themselves to achieve, in cooperation with the United Nations, the promotion of
            universal
            respect for and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms, Whereas a common understanding of these
            rights and freedoms is of the greatest importance for the full realization of this pledge, Now, therefore,
            The
            General Assembly, Proclaims this Universal Declaration of Human Rights as a common standard of achievement
            for
            all peoples and all nations, to the end that every individual and every organ of society, keeping this
            Declaration constantly in mind, shall strive by teaching and education to promote respect for these rights
            and
            freedoms and by progressive measures, national and international, to secure their universal and effective
            recognition and observance, both among the peoples of Member States themselves and among the peoples of
            territories under their jurisdiction.</p>
